      "Coding interviews are a form of technical interviews used to assess a potential software engineer candidate's competencies through presenting them with programming problems. Typically, coding interviews focus on data structures and algorithms, while other technical rounds may encompass system design (especially for middle to senior level candidates). A coding interview round is typically 30 - 45 minutes. You will be given a technical question (or questions) by the interviewer and will be expected to write code in a real-time collaborative editor such as CodePen or CoderPad (phone screen/virtual onsite) or on a whiteboard (onsite) to solve the problem within the given time.",
