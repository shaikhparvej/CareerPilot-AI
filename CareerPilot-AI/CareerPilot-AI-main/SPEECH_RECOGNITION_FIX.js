/*
 * SPEECH RECOGNITION ERROR FIX - APPLIED
 * =====================================
 * 
 * Problem: InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'start' on 'SpeechRecognition': recognition has already started.
 * 
 * Root Cause:
 * - Multiple rapid calls to startListening() before previous recognition fully stopped
 * - Race condition between speech synthesis ending and speech recognition starting
 * - No state tracking for recognition startup process
 * 
 * Solutions Applied:
 * 
 * 1. Added 'isStarting' state to prevent multiple simultaneous start attempts
 * 2. Force stop existing recognition before starting new one
 * 3. Increased delays between operations (500ms instead of 200ms)
 * 4. Better error handling for "already started" exceptions
 * 5. Proper cleanup of isStarting state in all exit paths
 * 
 * Files Modified:
 * - src/hooks/use-speech-recognition.ts (main fix)
 * - src/components/interview-session.tsx (timing improvements)
 * 
 * The fix ensures:
 * ✅ No duplicate recognition sessions
 * ✅ Proper state management
 * ✅ Graceful error handling
 * ✅ Race condition prevention
 * 
 * Test in browser at: http://localhost:3003 (Mock Interview feature)
