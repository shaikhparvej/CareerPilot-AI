# CareerPilot AI - Build Fix Instructions

The Vercel build was failing due to several issues:

## Issues Fixed

1. **Import Path Problems**: PreviewCourse.js was using incorrect import paths

   - Fixed by updating to use `@/` aliases

2. **Unsupported next.config.mjs Option**: The `api` configuration is not supported

   - Removed the unsupported configuration

3. **Missing Models**: Added the missing `AiChapterContent` model to AllAiModels.js

4. **Path Configuration**: Updated jsconfig.json to provide better path aliasing

## How to Test the Build

1. Run `npm run build` locally to ensure the build succeeds
2. If you encounter any more module not found errors, make sure to:
   - Check the import paths
   - Use the `@/` prefix for imports to leverage the path mappings
   - Create any missing files or components

## Project Structure Cleanup

Check the `delete_these_files.txt` file for a list of duplicate files that can be removed to simplify the project structure.

## Environment Variables

Make sure your Vercel project has these environment variables set:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
```

## Further Improvements

1. Consolidate duplicate code from `CareerPilot AI` directory
2. Consider using TypeScript more consistently across the project
3. Add proper error handling in API calls
